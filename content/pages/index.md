    text: "#### Hi, I'm John, a Psychologist and Open Science Advisor based between London and Rotterdam.\n\nFor the past 24-years, I have been attempting to make the complex simple and to support the development of young people. I am easily bored and am always looking for new challenges to keep life interesting. I consider myself a problem solver and some of the solutions I have found include: Creating the First Open Access Subject Repository for Sport, Exercise and Health related research called\_[SportRxiv](https://www.sportrxiv.org/), and bringing together a group of scientists from around the world to form the\_[Society for Transparency, Openness, and Reproducibilty in Kinesiology](https://www.tos-kin.org/)\_and build out from SportRxiv. Some other problems I am currently working on include changing the academic culture around research integrity through open science at\_[Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en), and figuring out how best to support online gamers with their mental health at\_[Play Aid](https://www.play-aid.org/). If you have a problem that you think I can help with,\_[drop me an email](mailto:your-email@example.com).\n"
