    text: "#### Hi, I'm John, a Psychologist and Open Science Advisor based between London and Rotterdam.\n\nI consider myself a problem solver and enjoy coming up with creative solutions. Some of my career highlights include:\n\n*   Creating the First Open Access Subject Repository for Sport, Exercise and Health related research called\_[SportRxiv,](https://www.sportrxiv.org/) so everyone around the world has freely available access to the full texts of hundreds of research articles in my scholarly domain.\n\n*   Forming the\_[Society for Transparency, Openness, and Reproducibility in Kinesiology](https://www.storkinesiology.org)\_and to solve the problem of how to fund and manage [SportRxiv](https://sportrxiv.org).\n\nSome other problems I am currently working on include changing the academic culture around research integrity through open science at\_[Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en), and figuring out how best to support online gamers with their mental health at\_[Play Aid](https://www.play-aid.org/).\n"
